# About INI

*INI* is a scripting (evaluated) language running on the top of a JVM. It aims at providing *a simple, safe and sound way to implement distributed and reactive computations* thanks to functions, processes, events and channels.

By default, INI uses *RabbitMQ* as a broker.

## Language Design Philosophy

INI is built around two first-class entities.

- *Functions*, as in *functional programming*, used for pure calculations.
- *Processes*, which are asynchronous, multi-threaded, rule-based, communicate through channels, and react to their environment with events (as in *reactive programming*). Rules in processes, implying an implicit repetition loop, are inspired from Dijkstra's guarded-command language ([Guarded commands, non-determinacy and formal derivation of programs - Commun. ACM 18 (1975), 8: 453â€“457](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd04xx/EWD472.PDF))

INI natively support essential constructs for distributed programming:

- Reliable & scalable communication through channels.
- Implicit multi-threading.
- Synchronization mechanisms.
- Declarative deployment (push and pull modes).

It comes with a built-in type inference engine to type check the programs. Also, following Dijkstra's guarded-command paradigm, it is well-suited to formal validation (especially model checking) in order to prove distributed programs correctness (WIP).

## Targeted Potential Uses/Applications

- Distributed Computing
- IoT/Robotics
- Pipelines and streaming computing
- Multi-Agent Systems
- Critical Systems

# Quick start

Requirements: Java 1.8+, Apache Maven (in your path)

Build with:

```console
$ cd {ini_root_dir}
$ mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

Start an INI shell (UNIX-based OS):

```console
$ cd {ini_root_dir}
$ bin/ini --shell
>
```

Type-in INI statements with INI shell:

```console
> s = "hello world" # defines a string variable 's'
hello world
> println(s) # prints out the content of s
hello world
> l = [1..4] # defines a list containing 4 integers
[1..4]
> inc = i => i+1 # defines a lambda that increments an integer
<lambda>(i)
> import "ini/lib/collect.ini" # imports the lib to support functions about collections
select(l,function)
> l.map(inc) # increments all the integers in 'l'
[2,3,4,5]
```

Launch INI programs (UNIX-based OS):

```console
$ cd {ini_root_dir}
$ bin/ini {ini_file} [{main_args}]
```

# Examples

The goal of these examples is to give a first overview of the INI syntax and semantics. Download the full [INI language specifications](https://github.com/cincheo/ini/raw/master/doc/ini_language_specs/ini_language_specs.pdf). Other examples can be found [here](https://github.com/cincheo/ini/tree/master/ini/examples).

## A factorial function

For pure local calculations, INI programmers can define functions. Here is a typical factorial calculation with INI. 

```javascript
function fac(n) {
  case n == 1 {
    return 1
  }
  case n > 1 {
    return n * fac(n-1)
  }
}

// prints out the result of the function
function main(args) {
  println(fac(to_int(args[0])))
}
```

To run the program, simply save it in a file (for instance ``fac.ini``), and type in:

```console
$ bin/ini fac.ini 3
6
```

## A factorial process (rule-based style)

On contrary to a function, a process runs asynchronously and can only contain rules (a.k.a. guarded commands). In an INI process, all the rules continue to be executed until none is applicable anymore or if the process has returned a value (using an explicit ``return`` statement). For instance, here is the factorial implementation with a process (rule-based style).

```javascript
process fac(n) {
  @init() {
    f = 1
  }
  // this rule will repeat until n == 0
  n > 0 {
    f = f * n--
  }
  @end() {
    return f
  }
}

// prints out the result of the function
function main(args) {
  println(fac(to_int(args[0])))
}
```

The second rule, guarded by ``n > 0``, continues to be executed until the ``n`` variable value becomes ``0``.

The ``@init`` and ``@end`` rules are called "event rules". The ``@init`` event is a one-shot event that is evaluated before all other rules, while the ``@end`` event is a one-shot event evaluated once no rules are left to be applied. Event rules may be asynchronous and run in their own thread (it is not the case for ``@start`` and ``@end`` events).

**Note**: it is important to understand that INI processes run asynchronously (in their own thread). They do not interrupt the thread of the function/process invoking them unless the invoking function/process reads the result of the invoked process. In that case, the invoking function/process waits until the invoked process returns a value. Under the hood, processes return *futures* instead of actual values. On contrary to many ``await/async`` systems, this mechanism is completely transparent for the programmer. In our example, the ``main`` function implicitly waits for the ``fac`` result because it uses it as an argument of the ``println`` function.

## The Euclidean Algorithm example

A famous example to demonstrate the use of guarded commands is the [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm), which efficiently finds the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers. Here is the INI code using a process and 2 rules (guarded commands):

```javascript
process gcd(a, b) {
  a < b {
    b = b - a
  }
  b < a {
    a = a - b
  }
  @end() {
    // repetition terminates when a == b == gcd(a,b) :)
    return a
  }
}

gcd(25, 15) // result => 5
gcd(17, 28) // result => 1
gcd(1260, 51375) // result => 15
```

## A process awaking every second

In INI, a process reacts to its environment through events. By default, a process will never end, unless none of the rules can apply anymore and all the events are terminated. 

The following INI program creates a process that will be notified every second (1000ms) by the ``@every`` event. It then evaluate the rule's action to print a tick and increments the tick count hold by the ``i`` variable.

```javascript
process main() {
  @init() {
    i = 1
  }
  @every() : [time=1000] {
    println("tick "+(i++))
  }
}
```

Note the ``: [time=1000]`` construct, which configures the ``@every`` event rule to be fired every second. This construct will be commonly used in INI programs and is called an *annotation*.

## A simple 3-process data pipeline

The basics of process communication is provided by *channels* (similarly to Pi calculus and most agent-based systems). Processes can produce data in channels using the ``produce`` function, and consume data from channel using the ``@consume`` event.

In the following program, the ``main`` process creates two sub-processes by calling ``p``. Each sub-process consumes a data from an ``in`` channel and produces the incremented result to an ``out`` channel. Thus, it creates a pipeline that ultimately sends back the data incremented twice to the main process.

```javascript
declare channel c0(Int)
declare channel c1(Int)
declare channel c2(Int)

process main() {
  @init() {
    p(c1, c2)
    p(c2, c0)
    println("processes started")
    c1.produce(1)
  }
  @consume(v) : [from=c0] {
    println("end of pipeline: "+v)
  }
}

process p(in, out) {
  @consume(v) : [from=in] {
    println("{in}: "+v)
    out.produce(v+1)
  }
}
```

The above program behaves as depicted here:

- ``main`` creates two sub-processes ``p(c1, c2)`` and ``p(c2, c0)``,
- ``main`` sends the data ``1`` to the ``c1`` channel (``c1.produce(1)``),
- ``1`` is consumed from ``c1`` by ``p(c1, c2)``, and ``2`` is produced to ``c2``,
- ``2`` is consumed from ``c2`` by ``p(c2, c0)``, and ``3`` is produced to ``c0``,
- finally, ``3`` is consumed from ``c0`` by ``main``, and the pipeline stops there.

Note the channel declarations at the beginning of the program. They ensure that the used channels are sound and well-typed. Channels  are global and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

# Distributed mode

So far, we have shown the INI capabilities without taking into account deployment on remote machines nor distributed communication between them. So, all the previous examples execute locally, on a single INI instance. Below, we explain how to use INI to support easy deployment and communication amongst an arbitrary number of INI nodes distributed across the network.

## Broker configuration

First install and start RabbitMQ.

Launch an INI node:

```console
$ cd {ini_root_dir}
$ bin/ini -n {node_name} {ini_file} # alternatively set the INI_NODE environment variable
```

For development (JUnit tests), INI uses the ``development`` environment, which defaults to a locally-installed RabbitMQ broker. In order to use another RabbitMQ instance, modify the ``ini_config.json`` configuration file to set the right connection parameters.

Ultimately, once moving an INI program to production, you should modify the ``production`` environment to connect to the production RabbitMQ broker. Then, select the ``production`` environment by setting the ``INI_ENV`` system environment variable to ``production``, or by using the ``--env`` option when running INI.

## INI nodes and auto-deployment

By default processes or functions are started on the current node (as given by the ``-n`` starting option). However, by simply using annotations, the programmer can decide on which (remote) INI node the process or functions shall be executed. There are two ways to deploy processes or functions remotely:

- Push the process/function on a remote node.
- Pull the process/function from a remote node.

## Push/spawn a process on a target node

Given the pipeline example explained above, to push/spawn the ``p`` processes to nodes ``n1`` and ``n2`` (assuming that these nodes have been properly launched), we just add the ``node`` annotation when starting the processes. Additionally, we also need to prefix the names of the channels with ``+``. By default, channels remain local to the current process and this prefix is required so that the channels become visible by all nodes (through the RabbitMQ broker).

```javascript
declare channel +c0(Int)
declare channel +c1(Int)
declare channel +c2(Int)

process main() {
  @init() {
    p(c1, c2) : [node="n1"]
    p(c2, c0) : [node="n1"]
    ... // the rest of the program is unchanged
```

In that case, the program of the ``main`` node acts like a coordinator for all the other processes in the distributed program.

A key point to remember is that when a process is spawned to a remote node, the required code (processes and functions) will be automatically fetched from the spawning node. So there is no need for the programmer to pre-deploy manually any piece of program on the INI nodes. INI will take care of all this transparently.

## Pull from a server node

In other cases, a given node may want to evaluate a function or a process that has been defined in another node. In that case, the target node may pull a function or a process from a remote server (any INI node). To do so, the target node needs to declare a function/process binding annotated with the right server node. For instance, the following program runs the ``hello(string)`` function, which has been defined on a node called ``server``. In that case, the ``hello`` method implementation is fetched from the server node and evaluated locally on the requesting node. 

```javascript
// this is a binding to a function declared on a remote server
declare hello(String)=>String : [node="server"]

function main() {
  println(hello("Renaud"))
}
``` 

Note that the binding of ``hello``, also defines the functional type ``(String) => String``, since INI cannot infer it from the function implementation.

# WIP: Type Safety and Model Checking

One of the most difficult point when building distributed applications (such as complex data pipelines and distributed computations), is  to ensure that they behave as expected. Since debugging them can be quite a complicated task, it is crucial to eliminate programming mistakes up-front as much as possible. To that purpose, INI provides two well-known mechanisms: strong typing through *Type Inference*, and formal validation through *Model Checking*.

## Type Inference

INI type system is formally defined in the [INI language specifications](https://github.com/cincheo/ini/raw/master/doc/ini_language_specs/ini_language_specs.pdf). Since INI implements type inference, the programmer does not have explicitly specify the types. Some exceptions can be noted, for instance when declaring bindings.

## Model Checking

Model checking is a robust technology that is used to prove properties when developing critical systems. Formal validation of INI programs is facilitated since the asynchronous part of the language is inspired from Dijkstra's guarded-command language ([Guarded commands, non-determinacy and formal derivation of programs - Commun. ACM 18 (1975), 8: 453â€“457](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd04xx/EWD472.PDF)). Derivating from Dijkstra's work, the Promela language and the Spin model checker have been widely used in the context of critical software development to prove the correctness of distributed/asynchronous programs. 

To ensure formal validation with model checking, INI provides an option to generate Promela code out of an INI program, which is basically an abstraction of how the processes behave. One can then use the SPIN type checker to ensure program properties, through the use of *Temporal Logic* (TL) formulae.

For instance, taking again the pipeline example given above, we can generate the corresponding abstract Promela code with the ``model-out`` option.

First, we need to add a couple ``model`` annotations to the program to define checkpoints. A checkpoint becomes true when the target expression is evaluated. It then can be used in a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) predicate to be verified by the Spin mode checker. For instance, here we check against the LTL predicate ``<> start => <> end``, i.e. if my program starts, it eventually ends.  

```javascript
declare channel +c0(Int)
declare channel +c1(Int)
declare channel +c2(Int)
declare predicate p1 (<> start => <> end)

process main() {
  @init() {
    p(c1, c2) : [node="n1"]
    p(c2, c0) : [node="n2"]
    println("processes started")
    c1.produce(1) : [model=[checkpoint=start]]
  }
  c = @consume(v) : [channel=c0] {
    println("end of pipeline: {v}")
    stop(c) : [model=[checkpoint=end]]
  }
}

process p(in, out) {
  c = @consume(v) : [channel=in] {
    println("{in}: {v}")
    out.produce(v+1)
    stop(c)
  }
}
```

Then, we can generate and check the corresponding Promela code:

```console
$ bin/ini --model-out model.pml pipeline.ini
```

Generated ``model.pml`` file:

```javascript
int _var_step = 0
int _step_max = 1000
bool _var_start=false
bool _var_end=false
chan c0=[10] of {byte}
chan c1=[10] of {byte}
chan c2=[10] of {byte}
active proctype main() {
  run p(c1, c2)
  run p(c2, c0)
  _var_start = true
  c1!1
  byte v
  do
    :: c0?v ->
      _var_step++
      _var_end = true
      break
    :: _var_step > _step_max -> break
  od
}
proctype p(chan in; chan out) {
  byte v
  do
    :: in?v ->
      _var_step++
      out!v+1
      break
    :: _var_step > _step_max -> break
  od
}
ltl p1 { (<>(_var_start)-><>(_var_end)) } 
```

It is possible to write an LTL formula to ensure that the pipeline will terminate, i.e., that at some point in the process execution flow, the ``main``'s ``@consume`` event will be triggered on channel ``c0``. 

Note that this is still work in progress and is not ready for production yet.

# WIP: Functional Channel Operators

We are currently working on a ``chanop.ini`` lib that provides a functional abstraction layer to build and deploy distributed computations using common operators on channels (map, reduce, filter, etc).

Here are some examples using ``chanop.ini``:

- [Distributed group-by using map/reduce operators](https://github.com/cincheo/ini/blob/master/ini/examples/distributed_computing/map_reduce.ini)
- [Distributed estimation of Pi using the Monte Carlo method](https://github.com/cincheo/ini/blob/master/ini/examples/distributed_computing/pi_estimation.ini)
